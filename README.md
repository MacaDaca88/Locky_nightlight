Fading Nightlight


The Nightlight is a smart fading nightlight designed to conserve battery during the day and provide a visually pleasing light show at night. The system uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and a sound sensor to control the LED lights.

Functionality:

LDR Control:
================================================================================
The LDR determines whether the ambient light is dark enough to justify turning on the LEDs. During daylight hours, the lights remain off to save battery power. Only when the light levels fall below a certain threshold will the system allow the LEDs to be turned on.

Sound Sensor:
================================================================================
The sound sensor detects claps. Each detected clap toggles the LEDs on or off, depending on their current state.
If a clap is detected during daylight hours, the LEDs will not turn on until the LDR detects darkness, ensuring the LEDs only operate when needed.

LED Fading:
================================================================================
The LEDs fade from left to right, with each bank of LEDs adjustable to fade at a different rate than the other side.
Both left and right LEDs cannot be on simultaneously, ensuring that the fading effect can be clearly observed across both channels.

Behavior:
================================================================================
When it is dark enough, a clap will toggle the LED lights.
If it is not dark enough, claps will have no effect on the LEDs until the LDR detects darkness.
The fading effect creates a dynamic light show, with left and right channels fading at different rates for a more engaging visual experience.


This system ensures efficient use of power while providing an aesthetically pleasing nightlight.
